"iOS 11 is finally available today for your iPhone and iPad, and among the many new features included in the update is Apple’s ARKit framework allowing developers to more easily create augmented reality apps and experiences. Here are some of the best ones you’ll want to try out after updating."
All of the Best Augmented Reality Tricks Your iPhone Can Do Right Now [Updated]
"To date, augmented reality has been more of a novelty than a genuinely useful tool on your smartphone. Seeing virtual pocket monsters appear in real life certainly added to the enjoyment of Pokémon Go, but who plays that any more? So hopefully, the same way the addition of the iTunes App Store made the original iPhone more interesting, ARKit will allow developers to help augmented reality find its true and useful calling."

Browse DIY furniture with IKEA Place

"Everything looks perfectly placed when you wander through IKEA’s labyrinth-like showroom. But to ensure that new couch you’ve been eyeing will actually fit in your living room, the furniture-makers’ new IKEA Place app lets you test virtual versions of its pieces in your home before they get delivered. It should also make it easier to decide on colors and finishes, and might even let you avoid battling weekend crowds at those massive Swedish warehouses altogether."

"Ensuring a $500 IKEA couch fits in your living room isn’t anywhere near as important as ensuring a $35,000 SUV will actually squeeze into your garage. So starting today, the Edmunds car shopping app will allow users to scan their garage or parking spot and then place virtual versions of different vehicles inside to confirm they’ll actually fit. It isn’t a replacement for a test drive, but why get your heart set on a giant Cadillac Escalade if you won’t be able to close your garage door once you get it home?

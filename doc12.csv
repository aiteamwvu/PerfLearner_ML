"There are more connected home gadgets to install than ever before, from locks to switches to speakers. What's worth the trouble? We asked Fortune editor Stacey Higginbotham what's in her house. Quite a bit, it turns out."
Indoor
1. Curb energy: Monitoring Device

Where: Inside circuit-breaker panel in garage; outside house
"Why: ""It's the smartest way to start because it gives you real-time energy consumption data for your entire home. An instant money saver."""

2. Ecobee 3 smart thermostat

Ecobee 
Where: In upstairs and downstairs hallways
"Why: ""It's another major system. It's programmable and saves money. And it cools the room you're in as opposed to Where the device is installed."""
"Buy here: Ecobee3 Thermostat, Ecobee3 bundle"
3. Sonos Wireless Speaker system

"Where: Kitchen, living room, bedrooms, bathrooms, rooftop deck"
"Why: ""If you like music, this wireless system is immersive. Play anything anywhere."""
"Buy here: Sonos Wireless, Sonos 2-Room Streaming, Sonos Compact Wireless"
4. Philips Hue Smart Light Bulbs

Where: Throughout the house
"Why: ""LEDs save money, and they can change colors to mimic a sunrise or sunset. I programmed them so that when my boss sent me a text message, they all turned red."""
"Buy here: Philips Hue, Philips Wake-Up Light"
5. Amazon Echo

Where: Kitchen
"Why: ""You can talk to it and control your Hue lights. My family asks it questions: 'How long is The Land Before Time? Where can I stream it from?' We use it all the time at dinner so that we don't have to pull out our smartphones."""
"Buy here: Amazon Echo, Amazon Dot"
6. SmartThings System

Where: In a closet underneath the stairs
"Why: ""It allows true systemic automation. And you can set rules. I have one sensor on my second-floor washing machine to ensure that it's not leaking and damaging the house."""
"Buy here: SmartThings Home Monitoring, SmartThings Water Leak Sensor"
7. Belkin WeMo Switch

"Where: Bathrooms, Kitchen"
"Why: ""This is a Wi-Fi-connected electrical outlet. It's useful for controlling the humidifier in a child's bedroom—you can turn it on and off with your phone—or appliances like a curling iron or coffeemaker."""
"Buy here: WeMo Switch, WeMo Wifi Bundle, WeMo Mini Smart Plug"
8. Lutron Dimmer Light Switches

"Where: Dining room, entrance hallway"
"Why: ""They work amazingly well. I replaced two switches in my house with these so I can dim a too-bright light and control an outdoor light, since there aren't any weatherproof connected bulbs yet."""
"Buy here: Lutron Wireless Single Kit, Lutron Wireless Smart Lighting Home Kit"
Outdoor
9. Jawbone UP3 Fitness Band

Where: On the wrist of the homeowner
"Why: ""Counterintuitive to choose this, I know. But you can link it to your house, and that's where it gets interesting. You can integrate with SmartThings so that when you wake up it will turn on the downstairs lights and start brewing coffee. I look at it as a personal trigger."""

10. Kwikset Z-Wave Locks

Where: Outside doors
"Why: ""Lock and unlock doors with the tap of a finger. What more is there to say?"""
"Buy here: Kwikset Touchscreen, Kwikset SmartCode"
11. Chamberlain Garage Door Opener
Where: Garage
"Why: ""This one is pretty straightforward. I can see if my garage door is open or closed from anywhere in the world using an app on my smartphone. With one swipe of my finger, I can open or close it. Pretty cool."""

"12. Jasco Z-Wave outdoor modules: Backyard, rooftop"
"Where: Backyard, rooftop"
"Why: ""They're outdoor-friendly outlets—great for controlling Christmas lights or fans with your smartphone."""

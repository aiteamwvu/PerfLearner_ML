Google Home + Chromecast
"Google Home is a voice-controlled smart speaker powered by Google Assistant. Although it normally sells for $129 on its own, Best Buy bundles it with Google Chromecast for the same price. "
Was $164. Is Now $129. See details on Best Buy


"Looking to make your home just a little smarter? While still in its infancy, the number of smart home products—devices that let you control your lighting, thermostat, or even your crock pot from your smartphone—is rapidly growing. From GE to Belkin to Home Depot, tons of products and whole ecosystems want to help you control your home via a single iOS or Android app. You can pick and choose your favorite gadgets to assemble an affordable intelligent abode on your own terms, or opt for an entire smart home system that does all the work for you. Here are some of our favorite smart home systems and individual gadgets."
"A ton of new smart home devices are coming out this year, and include new connected appliances, cameras, lightbulbs— even robots and trashcans. One common thread, though, is that many of these new devices will be compatible with Amazon Alexa, further integrating this voice assistant into your home. Plus, Amazon itself is launching several new Alexa-enabled devices, including the Echo Showand the Fire TV Edition, so you can get Alexa in even more places."

AMAZON ECHO
Best Smart Speaker
10-Aug
TOTALLY WORTH IT
REVIEW 
$179.99 Amazon

"Yes, it’s a Bluetooth speaker, but the Amazon Echo has a number of voice-activated features that let you control a number of smart home gadgets, as well as connect to other smart home hubs, such as those from Belkin and Samsung. It can also read you audiobooks, check the weather, and even let you purchase things online just by using your voice. And, as a speaker, it sounds great, too."

REVIEW 
$145 Amazon

"The Arlo Q's 1080p camera boasts excellent quality video, both day and night, has great motion detection, and a flexible scheduling feature. Best of all, though, is that you get a week's worth of video storage for free"

ECOBEE4
Best Smart Thermostat

SUPERIOR
REVIEW 
$249.99 Amazon

"The Ecobee4 has everything we liked about its predecessor, the Ecobee3, such as a slick touchscreen interface and a remote sensor that helps ensure all the rooms of your house are getting heated or cooled properly. But the newest version also has Alexa built in, so you don't need an Echo or an Echo Dot to control your other smart home devices, ask for the weather, or do anything else you can do with Amazon's voice assistant."

PHLIPS HUE WHITE A19 STARTER KIT
Best Light Bulb
10-Aug
TOTALLY WORTH IT
REVIEW 
$69 Amazon

"Philips Hue White starter kit includes two bulbs and a hub to connect them to other smart home devices. While you can't change these bulbs' colors, you can adjust their brightness (up to 800 lumens), and add up to 50 to a single hub. Philips' bulbs also work with a wide range of smart home systems, including Alexa, Apple HomeKit, IFTTT, Google Home, and Nest."

IHOME ISP5 SMARTPLUG
Best Smart Switch
10-Aug
TOTALLY WORTH IT
REVIEW 
US$42.99 Amazon

"A simple, and inexpensive way to make any device ""smart,"" you can control the power going to the ISP5 plug from your smartphone, wherever you are. We liked that iHome's app also lets you create a schedule to turn the plug on and off, and it can be linked to other smart home devices, such as Alexa, Wink and the Nest Learning Thermostat."

ROOST SMART BATTERY
Best Smoke/Carbon Monoxide Detector

SUPERIOR
REVIEW 
US$34.99 Amazon

"While the Nest Protect Smoke + CO2 alarm is great for those who want a 2-in-1 device that connects to several smart home devices, there's something to be said for the Roost Smart Battery. This $35 gadget plugs into any existing smoke or CO2 detector and makes it a smart device. Now, when your alarm goes of, it will alert you (and others) on your smartphone, from where you can either call 911, or silence the alarm, in case a piece of burnt toast is to blame. "

"This Amazon Echo competitor also has a built-in speaker, can respond to voice commands, and can both control smart home devices and stream music. But where the Google Home separates itself is its integration with Google Assistant, which lets you search for everything and anything. Plus, if you also have a Chromecast, you can control it via voice through Google Home. And, at $129, it's less expensive than the Echo."

SAMSUNG SMARTTHINGS
Best Smart Home Hub
10-Jul
VERY GOOD
REVIEW 
US$49 Amazon

"If you have a wide variety of smart home gadgets, you'll need a central system to integrate and control them all. While it has its imperfections, we found the Samsung SmartThings hub to be the best of the lot. It works with a wide range of devices and has a battery backup. Plus, Samsung will integrate this technology into its 2016 4K TVs, meaning you won't need to plug yet another gadget into your router."

CHAMBERLAIN MYQ GARAGE
Best Smart Garage Door Opener
$85.95 Amazon

"Searching or reaching for that elusive garage door opener remote while trying to navigate a dark suburban street, toppled garbage cans or your kids' toys – or your kids – often proves awkward and dangerous. Chamberlain's garage door opener lets you tap your device's screen to open or close your garage from anywhere. Soon, the company also plans to add geofencing capabilities so it can sense when you're near your driveway to automatically open and, when your car is safely ensconced inside, close your existing garage door. Part of the Home Depot/Wink ecosystem and Apple's soon-to-be HomeKit initiative, MyQ can control nearly every garage door opener from all the major brands manufactured after 1993."

KWIKSET SMARTCODE 916 TOUCHSCREEN ELECTRONIC DEADBOLT
Best Smart Home Lock
10-Aug
TOTALLY WORTH IT
REVIEW 
$202 Amazon

"The SmartCode 916's small size makes it less conspicuous than other locks, and allows you to use your old house keys if you want. Kwikset's SecureScreen feature — which makes you punch in two random digits before entering your code — helps ensure burglars can't guess your password by fingerprint smudges alone. And it has an alarm if someone tries to break in. The 916 lacks a standalone app, but can be connected to several smart home hubs via Z-wave or ZigBee. Overall, a great all-around lock that allows you to ease into the world of smart locks, ""unlocking"" its best features as you feel comfortable."

ANOVA PRECISION COOKER
Best Cookware

SUPERIOR
REVIEW 
$149 Amazon

"The Anova Precision Cooker is a sous-vide machine, which uses a hot water bath to cook your food to a precise temperature. (The food is sealed in a water-tight bag, so it retains all its juices). It's the easiest way to get perfectly medium-rare steaks, juicy chicken, and much more. Plus, it's easy to use, and its app comes with a ton of great recipes from Serious Eats."

NEW & NOTABLE
Samsung Connect Home
Amazon

"In the Connect Home, Samsung is packing its SmartThings Hub tech inside a mesh router. While Samsung is not the first to combine these two devices in one, the Connect Home will have 2x2 MIMO technology, which should improve performance among connected smart home devices. (A Pro version, with a 4x4 antenna and a faster processor, will also be sold.) Samsung has yet to announce pricing or availability."

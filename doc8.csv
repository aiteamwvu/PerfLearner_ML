Yield:,,,
2 pounds or 10 to 12 (4-inch) sausage links,,,
Level:,,,
Intermediate,,,
Ingredients,,,
1 1/2 teaspoons fennel seed,,,
2 teaspoons kosher salt,,,
1 1/2 teaspoons black pepper,,,
1 tablespoon chopped parsley leaves,,,
"2 pounds pork butt (2 1/2 pounds with bone), diced into 1/4-inch pieces",,,
5 feet of 36 millimeter collagen casings (do not allow to get wet at any time),,,
"Shortening, to lubricate nozzle of stuffer",,,
ADD CHECKED ITEMS TO GROCERY LIST,,,
Directions,,,
Special equipment: meat grinder with stuffing attachment or manual stuffer,,,
"Toast fennel seed in medium sized, heavy saute pan over medium heat, constantly moving seeds around in pan until they start to turn light brown, about 5 minutes. Set aside to cool. Once cool, grind seeds and combine with salt, pepper, and chopped parsley in medium mixing bowl. Add pork and blend thoroughly. Refrigerate for 1 hour. Using the fine blade of a grinder, grind the pork. After lubricating stuffer or stuffing attachment with shortening, load casing onto attachment, clipping end with a clothespin. Stuff meat into casings, trying to avoid air pockets. After stuffing is finished lay out on counter and tie off end. Pinch and twist to form 4-inch sausages. Wrap in parchment paper and refrigerate for 2 to 3 hours. Store in refrigerator for use within 2 to 3 days or freeze for up to 3 months. If freezing, wrap in aluminum foil. If using immediately, saute over medium heat in a heavy saute pan with 1/4-inch of water. Bring water to boil, put on lid and cook for 10 minutes. Remove lid and continue cooking over medium heat, turning every 2 to 3 minutes until golden brown. Sausage should reach an internal temperature of 150 to 156 degrees F.",,,

I loved this recipe. My local market had ground turkey on sale for  $.99 a pound so I used it and added granulated garlic and 3 tbs olive oil for extra fat. I made patties instead if putting it in casing.,,,

"I cheated a little bit, and it was awesome. Really surprised by how easy and tasty it was.",,,
,,,
"I only changed two things about this recipe. I used ground pork, and I didn't put it in the skin. I did follow the rest of the recipe as written.",,,
,,,
"I have now used the sausage in a couple of recipes, and it is really tasty. Spaghetti sauce with Italian sausage, browned it, and put it on some bread with cheese and sauce. I use it anywhere I would packaged sausage, except this really tastes fresher, it's cheaper than packaged and it's really easy.",,,

"I love this recipe. Did this at least thrice in 2006 and then again last week, 09/21/2012. Nothing beats Alton's recipes! This is even much better than those you eat at Italian restaurants here in North Beach in SFO. Excellent recipe. Thanks to Alton who knows the science of cooking and baking. Kudos!",,,

"This and Alton's breakfast sausage are my fave sausages. For me, this recipe is just right. Not too much fennel, salt, or spice. I have stuffed once, but I usually make this for bulk sausage for my Italian dishes. Im back now to make some more. Whenever pork goes on sale, I make sausage! The grinder for my KitchenAid is really the only accessory I use a LOT. Best investment for the best sausage.",,,

"This is the way my Italian family has made sausage for as long as I can remember. We did use the real casing, however. ",,,

"This is what I have been looking for. The taste i remember as a kid, and simple. I make 6 lbs of venison sausage at a time and stuff it. Did add 3 more tsp of fennel to the 6 lbs mix, as we like it alot. ",,,
"Man we all love it. The neighbors came over and tried it. Didn't tell them it was venison and they ate it all up. After I told them they couldn't believe it, and then took some home. ",,,
Thanks Alton,,,

"Nice simple recipe..the way Italian sausage should be, but grinding it fine? I would argue that it should be ground course....Twice !! And the meat should be kept as cold as possible thru the process. And collagen casings???? My grandfather would turn over! You can get probably get salted hog casings at your local supermarket or specialty store.Just soak and rinse well.",,,

"Very tasty AB! I thinned it out a little by adding more pork to the mix. I ended up making five pounds of sausage by doubling the spice recipe. Again, very tasty and easy to do.",,,
